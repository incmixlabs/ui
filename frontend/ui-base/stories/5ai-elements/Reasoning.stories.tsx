const shortReasoning = `I need to think about the best approach for implementing a React component that handles user authentication. Let me consider the key requirements:

1. Form validation for email and password
2. Error handling for failed login attempts
3. Loading states during authentication
4. Redirect after successful login

The most straightforward approach would be to use a controlled form with React Hook Form for validation and a custom hook for the authentication logic.`

const longReasoning = `To solve this complex algorithm problem, I need to break it down step by step:

First, let me understand what we're trying to achieve:
- We need to find the shortest path between two nodes in a weighted graph
- The graph can have negative edge weights
- We need to detect negative cycles

The Bellman-Ford algorithm would be perfect for this because:
1. It can handle negative edge weights (unlike Dijkstra's algorithm)
2. It can detect negative cycles
3. It has a time complexity of O(V*E) which is acceptable for most use cases

Here's my reasoning for the implementation:

1. **Initialization**: Set distance to source as 0 and all other distances as infinity
2. **Relaxation**: For V-1 iterations, relax all edges
3. **Cycle Detection**: Run one more iteration to check for negative cycles

The key insight is that if we can still relax edges after V-1 iterations, then there must be a negative cycle reachable from the source.

For the data structure, I'll use:
- An adjacency list to represent the graph (space efficient)
- A distance array to track shortest distances
- A predecessor array to reconstruct the path

Edge cases to consider:
- Self-loops with negative weights
- Disconnected components
- Very large graphs (memory constraints)
- Floating point precision issues

This approach will give us both the shortest paths and negative cycle detection in a single algorithm.`
