This project was created using `pnpm init` in pnpm v1.0.25. [pnpm](https://pnpm.sh) is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.
SharedWorker API to run the storage inside of a separate JavaScript process in browsers. Compared to a normal WebWorker, the SharedWorker is created exactly once, even when there are multiple browser tabs opened. Because of having exactly one worker, multiple performance optimizations can be done because the storage itself does not have to handle multiple opened database connections.
